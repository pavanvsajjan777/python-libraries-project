# Project 1 :Customer Churn Prediction System 
Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Random Forest, Matplotlib

Developed a Supervised Machine Learning model to predict customer attrition (churn) for a telecom service provider, aiding in proactive customer retention.

Performed extensive Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering on a dataset of 7,000+ customers, utilizing Pandas for data cleaning and One-Hot Encoding for categorical variable transformation.

Implemented and trained a Random Forest Classifier, achieving a prediction accuracy of ~79% on unseen test data.

Analyzed model performance using a Confusion Matrix to minimize false negatives and correctly identify high-risk customers.

#  Project 2 : EcoTrust – Decentralized Supply Chain Auditor
Developed an automated verification system using Python to detect fraudulent sustainability certificates in supply chains.

Integrated Generative AI (Google Gemini) to parse unstructured text and validate compliance with ISO 14001 standards.

Engineered a custom Blockchain ledger from scratch using SHA-256 hashing to ensure data immutability and prevent record tampering.

Orchestrated full system integration, linking the AI decision-making engine with the cryptographic ledger for real-time auditing
